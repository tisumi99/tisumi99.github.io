Its Your Life<br>
Its Your Heart<br>
Its The Way You Make Your Start<p>

Find Your Way<br>
Lose Your Way<br>
There Is Nothing You Can Say<p>

Now I'm Free<br>
What I Fear<br>
Want To Hold Your Frozen Tears<p>

Run Away<br>
With My Mind<br>
Cloud My Senses And My...<p>

I See Her Standing In The Fire<br>
She Calls My Name As I Pass Her<br>
I See The Thunder All Around Her<br>
I Know Her Name<p>

There's A Way<br>
That Is Light<br>
He Will Guide You In The Night<p>

Precious Blood<br>
That Was Shed<br>
Killed The Monster In Your Head<p>

Taste The Fire<br>
Feel The Wind<br>
Hide Your Face And Let Us In<p>

Hear The Voice<br>
Its A Choice<br>
Just A Mire To Paradise<p>

I See Her Standing In The Fire<br>
She Calls My Name As I Pass Her<br>
I See The Thunder All Around Her<br>
I Know Your Name<p>

Your The Queen Of Hearts<p>

Sittin' In My Room<br>
There Was A Knock At The Door<br>
I Got Up To Answer<br>
It Was My Dad<br>
"You No Good For Nothin'!"<br>
He Was Drunk<br>
So I Turned And Walked Away,<br>
He Came Up Behind Me<br>
Bam! He Hit Me With A Surprise Right<br>
I Went Down, All I Could Think Was....<p>

Tranq....<br>
Viol....<p>

On The Floor<br>
With My Eyes Swollen Shut<br>
My Mom Came Up To Me And Said,<br>
"Don't Hold It Against Your Dad,<br>
He's Had A Hard Life,<br>
He Doesn't Mean It When He Hits You,<br>
He Doesn't Mean It When He Hits Me"<br>
And About That Time<br>
Bam! He Hit Her With A Surprise Right<br>
She Went Down And All I Could Think Was....<p>

Tranq....<br>
Viol....<p>

Crossed My Room<br>
And Opened The Drawer<br>
And A-Pulled Out My Gun<br>
And A-Crossed My Room<br>
Went Into The Living Room<br>
Put The Gun To My Dad's Head<br>
Pulled Back The Trigger And About That Time<br>
My Mom Ran Up To Me And Said<br>
We Need To Pray<p>

<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 07 - Glory.mp3">Glory</a><br>
I Sing To You With All My Heart<br>
I Sing To You With All My Soul<br>
I Sing To You With All My Mind<p>

I See Your Hand Within My Life<br>
I See Your Hand Within My Strife<br>
I See Your Hand In All Its Might<p>

Show Me<br>
Show Me<p>

Glory!<p>
<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 08 - Georgia, Thanks for the Sunflower.mp3">Georgia, Thanks for the Sunflower</a><br>
No Matter Where I Am<br>
I Always Think Of You<br>
Anywhere I Go<br>
Your There With Me Too<p>

Georgia Sunflower<br>
No Other Girl Like You<br>
Georgia Sunflower<br>
Loyal, Sweet, And True<p>

Won't You Hold My Hand<br>
Catch A Glimpse Of You<br>
I Listen To Your Voice<br>
Can You Hear Me Too?<p>

Catch Me If You Can<br>
I Won't Run Too Fast<br>
The Pain I Knew Before<br>
All Thats In The Past<p>

Georgia Sunflower<br>
No Other Girl Like You<br>
Georgia Sunflower<br>
Loyal, Sweet, And True<p>

<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 09 - UpSideDown.mp3">UpSideDown</a><br>
When I Look At You, I See Myself,<br>
When I Look At You, I See My Wretched Self,<br>
When I Look At Myself, All I Want Is You,<br>
When I Look At Myself, What I Need Is You<p>

'Cause I'm Upside-Down<br>
I'm All Messed Up<br>
I'm All Screwed Up<p>
<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 10 - Magic Kingdom.mp3">Magic Kingdom</a><br>
I Kill Your Eyes<br>
I Kill Your Hands<br>
Feel The Anger<br>
Run And Hide<br>
In Homicide<br>
Do Your Slam<p>

Over Your High<br>
Harder You Try<br>
Feel Like Dancing<br>
A Bullet For You<br>
A Bullet For Me<br>
Who's The Lucky One<p>

Your Magic Kingdom<p>

Transited Soul<br>
You Find Your Way Around<br>
Fast Slow<br>
You Can't Stand The Sound<p>

I Heard What You Said<br>
I'd Rather See You Dead<br>
I Have You Misled<br>
My Kingdom In Your Head<p>

You Feel My Power Ride<br>
You Stand Beneath My Pride<br>
Yes My Delicious Friend<br>
I Lied To You Again<p>
<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 11 - Thorn of Rage.mp3">Thorn of Rage</a><br>
Livin' Like A Dog Among A Swine<br>
Among A Trough Of Slime<br>
I Wanna Puke In All Those Times<br>
That Kissed Me Off<br>
Don't Give A Damn About<br>
All The Things They Wanna Fight<br>
I Wanna Cream Another Punk<br>
Because I'm Mean From<br>
All The Pretty Things I've Seen<p>

Thorn Of Rage<p>

Just Kneel Down Beside The Bench<br>
All You Do Is Pay Your Money And Forget The Rest<br>
I Said Forget It Man<br>
I Wanna Know The Lord<br>
I Wanna Take Up His Cross<br>
I Wanna Take Up His Sword<br>
It Doesn't Matter If Your Black or White<br>
The Lord Says We're Sacred So Deal With That<br>
And Don't Bend The Word To Fit Your Style<p>

Thorn Of Rage<p>

Your Prayers Aren't Answered You Wonder Why<br>
Its Probably 'Cause You Don't Know The Guy<br>
You Gotta Know Who Your Talking To<br>
'Cause If You Don't, Well Its No Use<br>
You Gotta Find Time To Read The Word<br>
I Say Everyday, You Say Thats Absurd<br>
You Gotta Love The Lord, Your God<br>
With All Your Heart<br>
And Then All Your Mind<p>

Thorn Of Rage<p>
<a href = "/eastwest/East West - Rachel's Silence - 12 - Mother's Day.mp3">Mother's Day</a><br>
I've Heard The Words<br>
I've Seen The Lies,<br>
I've Felt The Pain<br>
Thats In Your Eyes<p>

Mother's Day<p>

And now Your Gone<br>
Has Jesus Won?<br>
You Fell From Grace<br>
Its Not My Place<p>

Mother's Day<p>
